-   formatting that consumes the search engine? (seems smart)

receive inputs[] then run through a image data store that returns the data that includes the image url and structured with separate categories so can then be injected in the html template

^^ this might be a function used in the search engine to format the data

html template that for loops the object data categories

shit this needs to take in consideration the cards data at the end
